A name. A message. Nobodyâ€™s shit. A hike. A hit. A beating.

Notes. A page from their book. Criticism.

A walk on the wild side. Ice with your drink. Salt with your margarita. A sip. Directions. Risks. A joy ride. 

The red pill. The car into the shop.

What you can get. The money and run. The long way home. The trash out.

A seat. Time off. An oath. Turns. The rap for it. It all in.

A break. Everything for granted. A moment to think about it. A different route. It all back. A life. Your life. A joke.
